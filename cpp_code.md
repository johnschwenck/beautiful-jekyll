### Spatial Bayesian Quantile Regression Using Electricity Network Data
This project is currently under development.

Utilizing the data collected from the ERCOT_scraper Python package, this package relies on low-level C++ code to enhance the processing speed needed to make predictions in real-time for spatial network analyses. This estimated completion date is scheduled for the end of 2020.
