My personal website, johnschwenck.github.io uses this repo. I have used beautiful-jekyll theme as a starter. If you want a similar website, please start directly with [beautifull-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).

As something to play around with, [here](https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?reportId=bf210cab-cfd1-415a-bfbe-c582c3357bc1&autoAuth=true&ctid=68f381e3-46da-47b9-ba57-6f322b8f0da1&config=eyJjbHVzdGVyVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93YWJpLXVzLW5vcnRoLWNlbnRyYWwtcmVkaXJlY3QuYW5hbHlzaXMud2luZG93cy5uZXQvIn0%3D) is a dashboard I made in Power BI using personal data collected from my cycling trip across North America in 2019. I rode for 95 days over 5,775 miles from Central Park in NYC to Seward, Alaska!
