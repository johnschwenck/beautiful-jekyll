Exactly one year ago today, on July 19th 2019, I completed what seemed like an insurmountable goal of riding my bicycle 5,775 miles across the North American continent from Central Park, New York City to Seward, Alaska. [Here's proof.](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjdmYTAzMmEtZjllZS00Mzg4LTljZDMtMTQ1Y2EyODJkNmQ1IiwidCI6IjY4ZjM4MWUzLTQ2ZGEtNDdiOS1iYTU3LTZmMzIyYjhmMGRhMSIsImMiOjN9)

It took 95 days and spanned 13 U.S. states and 3 Canadian provinces. I endured sandstorms, tornadoes, subzero temperatures, thunderstorms, blizzards, mudslides, hailstorms, forest fires, and came within an arm's reach of over 14 different species of voracious wildlife including grizzly bears, moose, bison, and mountain lions all while riding my father's beat-up old 1991 Cannondale bicycle.

It was the ultimate test of mental endurance. While I knew it was not going to be some ebullient happy-go-lucky joyride, I never expected to face such an incessant barrage of bad luck. What I encountered was nothing remotely close to what I initially had in mind. Between the --- and the inclement weather that seemed to follow me no matter what part of the country I rode in, I couldn't seem to catch a break the entire trip. 

Speaking of bad weather...

Quite comically, within the very first 10 minutes into the trip it started to downpour so hard in NYC that I could barely see in front of me. I ended up doing a full 7-mile loop detour around Central Park. I didn't even realize I did so until I saw at least 50 text messages asking what on earth I was doing and checked my Strava recording later that night. Ironically, with that added detour, I ended up in my hometown on my first night. I was off to a great start...

The natural question you may ask yourself is why I would ever want to ride my bicycle that far. To be completely honest, I wasn't a diehard cyclist prior to that trip. Hell, I wasn't even any kind of cyclist. I started training for it a couple months before I left, and by training I mean riding for 10-15 miles. To put this into perspective, during my trip I averaged around 70-100 miles per day. I would always give people the joking answer that I wanted to "one-up" my father who also rode his bicycle across the U.S. when he was 25 in 1991, who "only" went 3,200 miles from NJ to San Diego. Well, I think it's safe to say I have him beat (and I used his 28-year old bicycle! ....mom story?

The real reason, perhaps surprisingly, was that I wanted to conduct research and collect data on myself. Not just summary statistics of what my average heart rate and total distance were. I collected extremely granular data that encapsulated all parts of my medical well-being; health data such as second-by-second heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), sleep stage duration, blood pressure, nutritional diet information and food logs, activity data, electroencephalography (EEG) data, electrocardiography (ECG) data, and not to mention the dozens of geospatial variables such as elevation, distance, wind speeds, weather, etc.
