Welcome to my site! My name is John Schwenck and I am currently a graduate student at Texas A&M University pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Statistics. I am interested, specifically, in Bayesian Inference as well as Dimension Reduction as they pertain to various machine learning algorithms. I find enjoyment in applying these methodologies to serious endeavors such as commodity market predictions, reservoir charicterization, and biostatistical applications, but also on a leisurely level with Poker and Football (NFL) analytics.

### Undergraduate Education: *Penn State University*
I am a graduate of the Pennsylvania State University (2016) where I completed my undergraduate degrees in Economics (B.S.) and Supply Chain & Information Systems (B.S.) with a minor in Statistics. During my studies, I completed over 170 credit hours related to areas within the mathematics & statistics, energy, and finance disciplines. I am the founder of the Penn State Energy Marketing Association [(PSEMA)](https://www.pennstateema.com/), a research organization dedicated to bridging the gap between technical and non-technical backgrounds by collaborating on commodity market research using a variety of statistical models.

### Professional Experience
Professionally, I have acquired and refined my programming proficiency in R, Python, SQL, Stata, VBA/Excel, and have become fluent in Power BI software. Specifically, I have utilized these skills during my professional tenure at SJI (formerly South Jersey Industries) to optimize departmental metrics across the company. In addition to my time at SJI, I have consulted for various firms & individuals independently to assist with statistical modeling and automation tasks. Currently, I serve as the Lead Statistician for the Applied Cognitive & Ergonomics [(ACE)](https://acelab.tamu.edu/) lab at Texas A&M University.

### Graduate Education: *Texas A&M University*
Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degree at Texas A&M University where I have been fortunate enough to enroll in a wide variety of coursework covering both statistics and computational-related topics. Throughout Spring 2020 I have served as a Teaching Assistant (GAT) with lab responsibilities and plan to continue during the Fall of 2020. This Summer, I have had the privilege of working alongside [Dr. Irina Gaynanova](https://irinagain.github.io/) to engage in Continuous Glucose Monitoring research which seeks to apply the latest statistical methodologies to the health & wearables space. This Fall, I will be serving as a statistical consultant for the Texas A&M Athletics department where I will develop models and methodologies for improving athlete performance from a physiological perspective across all sports.  

### Personal Research
In 2019, I rode my bicycle 5,775 miles from New York City to Seward, Alaska to collect granular health and geospatial data for research purposes. Although a pilot study in nature, the data has allowed me to employ various statistical methods to uncover insights in cardiac performance which I hope to replicate in future research with a more representative sample. I am currently evaluating options for developing a mobile application that will allow others to collect the same data to make the study more representative.
