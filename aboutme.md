Welcome to my site! My name is John Schwenck and I am currently a graduate student at Texas A&M University pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Statistics. I am interested, specifically, in Bayesian Inference as well as Dimension Reduction as they pertain to various machine learning algorithms. I find enjoyment in applying these methodologies to serious endeavors such as commodity market predictions, reservoir charicterization, and biostatistical applications, but also on a leisurely level with Poker and Football (NFL) analytics.

I am a graduate of the Pennsylvania State University where I completed my undergraduate degrees in Economics (B.S.) and Supply Chain & Information Systems (B.S.) with a minor in Statistics. During my studies, I completed over 170 credit hours related to areas within the mathematics & statistics, energy, and finance disciplines. I am the founder of the Penn State Energy Marketing Association (PSEMA), a research organization dedicated to bridging the gap between technical and non-technical backgrounds by collaborating on commodity market research using a variety of statistical models.

Professionally, I have acquired and refined my programming proficiency in R, Python, SQL, Stata, VBA, and Excel. Specifically, I have leveraged logistic regression, time series analysis, machine learning, and spatiotemporal modeling to improve all aspects of SJI's operating performance and have experience addressing data science challenges across all business functions.

### Personal Project
Recently, I rode my bicycle 6,000 miles from New York City to Seward, Alaska to collect granular health and geospatial data to analyze during my graduate studies. Although a pilot study in nature, I will employ various statistical methods to uncover insights in cardiac performance. I am currently evaluating options for developing a mobile application that will allow others to collect the same data to make the study more representative.
