Welcome to my site! My name is John Schwenck and I am currently a graduate student at Texas A&M University pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Statistics. I am interested the general domain of machine learning, but specifically in computationally-intensive areas such as Bayesian inference, dimensionality reduction, spatial interaction networks, and natural language processing (NLP). I find enjoyment in applying these methodologies to serious endeavors such as commodity market predictions, reservoir charicterization, and biostatistical applications, but also on a leisurely level with Poker and Football (NFL) analytics.

### Undergraduate Education: *Penn State University*
I am a graduate of the Pennsylvania State University (2016) where I completed my undergraduate degrees in Economics (B.S.) and Supply Chain & Information Systems (B.S.) with a minor in Statistics. During my studies, I completed over 170 credit hours related to areas within the mathematics & statistics, energy, and finance disciplines. I am the founder of the Penn State Energy Marketing Association [(PSEMA)](https://www.pennstateema.com/), a research organization dedicated to bridging the gap between technical and non-technical backgrounds by collaborating on commodity market research using a variety of statistical models and computational tools.

### Professional Experience
Professionally, I have acquired and refined my programming proficiency in R, Python, SQL, VBA/Excel, and have recently gained fluency with C++. I also have mastered various visualization software such as Power BI, Shiny Apps, and Dash. During my professional tenure at SJI (formerly South Jersey Industries), I have utilized these skills to optimize departmental metrics across the company. In addition to my time at SJI, I have consulted for various firms & individuals independently to assist with statistical modeling and automation tasks. 

### Graduate Education: *Texas A&M University*
At Texas A&M University, I am pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Statistics where I have been fortunate enough to enroll in a wide variety of coursework covering both theoretical and computational-related topics. During my first year, I served as the Lead Statistician for the Applied Cognitive & Ergonomics [(ACE) lab](https://acelab.tamu.edu/) where I oversaw analyses and ensured statistical legitimacy before publication. Throughout both Spring and Fall 2020, I have also served as a Teaching Assistant (GAT) with lab responsibilities for an Intro to Data Science Course that relies on Python programming. 

I currently have the privilege to work alongside [Dr. Irina Gaynanova](https://irinagain.github.io/) as a graduate researcher to focus on applying the latest statistical methodologies to Continuous Glucose Monitoring (cgm) and other technologies in the health & wearables space. With respect to cgm, I have focused on analyzing glucose level variability via sleep curves. While currently under development, I have also been tasked with the creation of an R package that analyzes ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (abpm) data which, to our knowledge, is the first abpm software package (soon to be) publicly available. 

Most recently, I have also been working a data scientist / statistical consultant for the [Texas A&M Athletics](https://www.tamu.edu/athletics/index.html) department where I analyze athlete performance from both a physiological and strategic perspective by utilizing high-resolution spatio-temporal data and visualizing it via Power BI for coaches and athletes.

### Personal Research
In 2019, I rode my bicycle 5,775 miles from New York City to Seward, Alaska to collect granular health and geospatial data for research purposes. Although a pilot study in nature, the data has allowed me to employ various statistical methods to uncover insights in cardiac performance which I hope to replicate in future research with a more representative sample. I am currently evaluating options for developing a mobile application that will allow others to collect the same data to make the study more representative and will implement various machine learning algorithms to enhance personal health and wellbeing.
