Welcome to my site! My name is John Schwenck and I am currently a graduate student at Texas A&M University pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Statistics. I am interested the general domain of machine learning, but specifically in computationally-intensive areas such as Bayesian inference, dimensionality reduction, spatial interaction networks, and natural language processing (NLP). I find enjoyment in applying these methodologies to serious endeavors such as commodity market predictions, reservoir charicterization, and biostatistical applications, but also on a leisurely level with Poker and Football (NFL) analytics.

### Graduate Education: *Texas A&M University*
I am currently in pursuit of a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Statistics at Texas A&M University where I have been fortunate enough to enroll in a wide variety of coursework covering both theoretical and computational-related topics. During my first year, I served as the Lead Statistician for the Applied Cognitive & Ergonomics [(ACE) lab](https://acelab.tamu.edu/) where I oversaw analyses and ensured statistical legitimacy before publication. Throughout both Spring and Fall 2020, I have also served as a Teaching Assistant (GAT) with lab responsibilities for an Intro to Data Science Course that relies on Python programming. 

I currently have the privilege to work alongside [Dr. Irina Gaynanova](https://irinagain.github.io/) as a graduate researcher to focus on applying the latest statistical methodologies to Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and other technologies in the health & wearables space. With respect to CGM, I have focused on analyzing glucose level variability via sleep curves and the effect that sleep apnea has on Type II diabetics. While currently under development, I have also been tasked with the creation of an R package that analyzes ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) data which, to our knowledge, is the first ABPM software package (soon to be) publicly available. 

Most recently, I have also been working a data scientist / statistical consultant for the [Texas A&M Athletics](https://www.tamu.edu/athletics/index.html) department where I analyze athlete performance from both a physiological and strategic perspective by utilizing high-resolution spatio-temporal and physiological data, and visualizing it via Power BI for coaches and athletes.

### Professional Experience
During my 3 year professional tenure at SJI (a $2.1B natural gas local distribution company formerly known as South Jersey Industries) between my undergraduate and graduate education, I parlayed my quantitative savvy to optimize departmental metrics across the company as a Senior Analyst and implemented a wide variety of statistical methodologies to improve performance. I was tasked with devising profitable trading strategies, developing empirical HR screening protocols, and efficiently allocating resources for the damage prevention department through the use of machine learing in risk analysis, among others. In addition to my time at SJI, I have consulted for various firms & individuals independently to assist with statistical modeling and automation tasks. 

### Undergraduate Education: *Penn State University*
I am a graduate of the Pennsylvania State University (2016) where I completed over 170 credit hours towards my undergraduate degrees in Economics (B.S.) and Supply Chain & Information Systems (B.S.) with a minor in Statistics. I am the founder of the Penn State Energy Marketing Association [(PSEMA)](https://www.pennstateema.com/), the university's first research organization dedicated to collaborating on commodity market research using a variety of statistical models and computational tools.

### Technical Expertise
Aside from my statistical aptitude, I have mastered and refined my programming proficiency in R, Python, SQL, VBA/Excel, and have recently gained fluency with Git/Github and C++. Additionally, I have professional experience with various visualization software such as Power BI, Shiny Apps, and Dash.

### Personal Research
In 2019, I rode my bicycle 5,775 miles from New York City to Seward, Alaska to collect granular health and geospatial data for research purposes. Although a pilot study in nature, the data has allowed me to employ various statistical methods to uncover insights in cardiac performance which I hope to replicate in future research with a more representative sample. I am currently evaluating options for developing a mobile application that will allow others to collect the same data to make the study more representative and will implement various machine learning algorithms to enhance personal health and wellbeing.
