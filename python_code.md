The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) utilizes a Management Information System (MIS) to distribute market and grid information for market participants. Using their MIS tool, this Python code serves to extract all available information pertaining to Day-Ahead markets, Real-Time markets, and various operational related information.

While still in development, this data will be utilized to assess trading patterns across market participants at various locations. It will rely on spatio-temporal methods and utilize computational methods that will be able to tackle such vast quantities of data. Once the data collection process is streamlined, a dashboard will be created to visualize such patterns.
