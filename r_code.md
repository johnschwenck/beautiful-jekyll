### *[iglu](https://github.com/irinagain/iglu)*: Interpreting Glucose Data from Continuous Glucose Monitors
***iglu*** provides functions for outputting relevant metrics for data collected from Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) and can be utilized on any dataset containing the necessary CGM data fields. See [Rodbard (2009)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/dia.2008.0132) for reference. The package is the result of a team effort led by [Dr. Gaynanova](https://github.com/irinagain) and her Aggie Research Program team and a research collaboration with Johns Hopkins University.

### ***[bp](https://github.com/johnschwenck/bp)***: Blood Pressure Analysis in R
This project is currently under development.

The **bp** package is the first open source R software package dedicated to assessing various blood pressure metrics and trends. The estimated completion date is scheduled for the end of 2020.

### Riding For Research: NYC to Alaska
In the summer of 2019, I rode my bicycle 5,775 miles from New York City, New York to Seward, Alaska in an effort to collect various high-resolution geospatial and biometric data, including continuous heart rate, blood pressure, spatial coordinates, weather, and nearly 50 others. The data is all currently hosted on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/r4r) and the final Power BI dashboard is available [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjdmYTAzMmEtZjllZS00Mzg4LTljZDMtMTQ1Y2EyODJkNmQ1IiwidCI6IjY4ZjM4MWUzLTQ2ZGEtNDdiOS1iYTU3LTZmMzIyYjhmMGRhMSIsImMiOjN9) (and in the dashboard tab at the top of this page), but I am still working on migrating all of my code to a public GitHub repository. The estimated completion date for this migration is end of 2020.
